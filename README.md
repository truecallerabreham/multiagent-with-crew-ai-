**Platform:** Google Colab

## 🧠 Project Overview

This project demonstrates a **multi-agent AI system** built using the **CrewAI framework**, where multiple autonomous agents collaborate or act independently to complete distinct tasks.  
The system includes two specialized agents:

1. **Senior Technical Writer Agent** – generates and refines technical documentation, reports, or research summaries in a professional tone.  
2. **Professor Agent** – explains complex academic or theoretical concepts in an easy, structured, and educational way.  

Each agent operates **independently** within the same environment but with its own role, objective, and reasoning flow.

## ⚙️ Core Idea

The goal is to explore **modular, role-based AI agent architectures**, where each agent can focus on a different cognitive or functional task.  
By isolating roles, the system allows better clarity, maintainability, and scalability — similar to how teams of specialists work together in the real world.

The implementation uses **CrewAI**, a Python library that simplifies multi-agent orchestration.

## 🏗️ System Design

### Agent 1 – Senior Technical Writer
- Task: Produces, edits, and reviews technical documents or structured write-ups.  
- Skills: summarization, clarity improvement, tone consistency.  
- Tools: language model APIs (LLMs), text templates, custom prompt-chains.  

### Agent 2 – Professor
- Task: Teaches or explains a topic step-by-step with examples and analogies.  
- Skills: educational clarity, logical structuring, simplification of difficult concepts.  
- Works independently from the writer agent.

## 🔩 Implementation Steps

1. **Initialize CrewAI** and define agent roles and objectives.  
2. **Create agent configurations** (prompts, temperature, model, max tokens).  
3. **Implement communication flow** (independent or collaborative).  
4. **Run and observe outputs** for each agent.  
5. Optionally expand to include coordination or evaluation mechanisms.

## 🧰 Technologies & Tools

- **Python 3**  
- **CrewAI** — multi-agent orchestration  
- **OpenAI / LLM APIs** — for reasoning and text generation  
- **Google Colab** — development and execution environment  

---

## 📈 Key Features

- Independent multi-agent execution (agents do not depend on one another).  
- Role-based task separation.  
- Extensible architecture — new agents can easily be added.  
- Fully written, configured, and executed inside a Google Colab notebook.
